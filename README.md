How to use
----------  
 Users calling to your Twilio number will be answered by Phone Pay's interactive voice response system (IVR) and lead to pay through Stripe. User will be prompted to enter credit card details by IVR. Phone Pay does not store any credit card details on server. All call logs and payment details will be available in Admin Panel. Admin can manage orders and also if needed, refund the amount to the payer.

Phone Pay can be configured in four different modes called system behavior. System behavior is switchable based on your needs at any time from admin panel.The four system behaviors are as follows.  

1-Fixed Payment with Order ID  

 Admin fixes an amount for all payments.  User will be asked to enter Order ID and then lead to pay the fixed amount.   Also admin can create order with order ID and payable amount.  User entering an existing order ID will be lead to pay corresponding amount.    

2-Fixed Payment without Order ID   

User will be directly lead to pay a fixed amount that has set by admin. No Order ID will be asked.  
 
3-User defined Payment with Order ID  

User will be asked to enter the amount they wish to pay after entering Order ID.  Also admin can create order with order ID and payable amount.  User entering an existing order ID will be lead to pay corresponding amount.

4-User defined Payment without Order ID  

User will be lead to pay the amount they wish to pay.  
 
Phone Pay works with Twilio and Stripe. You should have working phone number with Twilio and an active stripe account to start phone pay.
